# Document Similarity Tool

The Document Similarity Tool is an application designed to compare the similarity between two documents. It uses a **Levenshtein Distance** algorithm to calculate the similarity percentage based on the contents of the documents.

This project is built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. The backend handles the logic for document comparison and stores the documents, while the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and comparing documents.

## Features

- Compare two documents by calculating the similarity percentage.
- User-friendly frontend built with React.
- Backend built with Spring Boot.
- Seamless communication between frontend and backend via REST API.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Algorithm**: Levenshtein Distance for similarity comparison
- **API Testing**: Postman
